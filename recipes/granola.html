    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. <strong>Why?</strong> Well is extremely customizable and is one of the backbones of my home cooking.</p>
    <p>This granola can be customized so it includes your favorite toppings. The important thing here is to learn the base ratio. However, I will add two iterations so you have somewhere to start.</p>
    <h2>First iteration: Chocolate Granola</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of raw rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of slivered almonds</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of puffed rice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of neutral taste oil. I personally use avocado</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of agave syrup.</li>
            <1i>1 tbspn of vainilla extract</1i>
            <li>2 to 2.5 tbspns of cocoa powder</li>
            <li><em>Optional</em>, 1/2 tspn of espresso powder</li>
            <li>2 pinches of salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Second iteration Cinnamon Granola</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of raw rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of coconut flakes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of puffed rice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of neutral taste oil. I personally use avocado oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of agave syrup. Honey also works wonders here</li>
            <1i>1 tbspn of vainilla extract</1i>
            <li>2 tbspns of cinnamon powder</li>
            <li>2 pinches of salt</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Optional Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried cranberries</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Any other dried fruit of your choice.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven for 325 F</li>
            <li>In a large bowl combine the oats, the toppings (puffed rice, pumpkin seeds, etc.) and the salt.</li>
            <li>Then add the wet ingridients and mix until the granola mixture is distributed</li>
            <li>Spread the granola mixture on a baking sheet that has been previosly greased or it has a baking mat. The key here is to spread it as thin and even as possible.</li>
            <li>And into the oven goes for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, flip the mixture so it toast in both sides. Put it back in for 12-15 minutes until color of your preference. I usually go for golden brown.</li>
            <li>After is done let it cool. After is cold, mix it with any dried fruit or chocolate chips. Store it in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
