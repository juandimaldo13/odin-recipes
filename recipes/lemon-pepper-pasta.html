    <h2 class="card title">Description</h2>
    
    <p>This simple yet delightful recipe is great for a fresh but a bit cozy meal. 
        It is great to do in bulk and invite some friends over. I would not recommend 
        for meal prep as it does not hold very well its freshness </p>

     <h3 class="card subtitle"> Lime vs Lemon Debate</h3>   
     <p>This recipe can use both lime or lemosn depending on personal preference. Personally,
        preferr limes as they are a little more sharp on the acidness, but provides a great flavor, 
        a bit of umami and also is easy to balance. My recommendation if you use Lemons is to 
        not use any sweetner at the start and then balance it little by litte.

    <h2 class="card title">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by bringing some water to boil to cook the pasta. Once it is boiling add around 4 pinches of salt. </li>
        <li>Prepare your chicken by dicing it into bite size pieces and season it with salt, ginger and garlic powder. Let it rest</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut the carrots in small batons. Cut the onion in slices or <em>julienes</em>. </li>
        <li>In a big frying pan or dutch oven, add the neutral oil of your preference and heat it up. Sautee the carrots on medium to high heat for 4 min, then add the onions for 2 mins. We want to add some caramelization but not cook them through </li>
        <li>While the vegetables cook, this is when you put the pasta to cook according to the manufacturer instructions. </li>
        <li>Remove the vegetables and put them on the side. Add a bit more oil, heat it up and cook the seasoned chicken. </li>
        <li>While the chicken cooks, zest the two limes on a separate bowl and squish out the juice. </li>
        <li>Combine the chicken stock with the lime juice and toss it to the pan once the chicken is almost done cooking. This with deglaze the pan so make sure you scrap all the little bits.</li>
        <li>Add back the vegetables after you deglaze and add the honey to balance. At this point you correct seasoning with salt.</li>
        <li>The pasta should be ready around the chicken is also done, so toss the pasta to the pan with around 1/4 cup of the pasta water and the knob of butter. Mix everything and reduce for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finish up with Parmesan cheesee, the lime zest and plate up.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optionally,</strong> before serving add chopped chives and parsley and mix up for a pop of color.</li>
    </ul>
