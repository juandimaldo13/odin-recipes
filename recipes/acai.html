    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes to do at home as I love acai bowls. The only problem with them is that 
        they are so expensive. Sometimes, there are not even the toppings I want. So I took the 
        task on my hands to make the best acai bowl possible at home.
    </p>

    <p>This is also a great saving money opportunity or, if you happen to have a large freezer, to do a bunch of 
        acai bowls to have them whenever you are ready. 
        Also, it is a great opportunity to use the <a href="granola.html">amazing granola</a> recipe.
